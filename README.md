<h3>Design a normalized database schema for the following requirement.</h3>
<h3>The requirement:</h3>A library wants to maintain the record of books, members, book issue, book return, and fines collected for late returns, in a database. The database can be loaded with book information. Students can register with the library to be a member. Books can be issued to students with a valid library membership. A student can keep an issued book with him/her for a maximum period of two weeks from the date of issue, beyond which a fine will be charged. Fine is calculated based on the delay in days of return. For 0-7 days: Rs 10, For 7 â€“ 30 days: Rs 100, and for days above 30 days: Rs 10 will be charged per day.
